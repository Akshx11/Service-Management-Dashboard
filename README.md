Service Requests Management Dashboard"! 🚀 Here's a snapshot of what the dashboard entails:

📍 Total Payment Amount by Region: Visualizing the financial impact, my dashboard provides a clear breakdown of the total payment amount for each region. This insight not only allows for better financial management but also highlights areas of high transaction activity.

📅 Average Monthly Service Requests: A key metric for optimizing service efficiency, I've incorporated a dynamic view showcasing the average number of service requests sent each month. This data-driven approach aids in resource allocation and process enhancement.

💡 Learning Milestones:As I crafted this dashboard, I gained valuable skills in data integration, visualization, and interaction. The journey involved querying data from diverse sources, designing meaningful charts and graphs, and even creating geographical insights to map service trends.
